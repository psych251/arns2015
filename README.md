Replication study using existing resting state electroencephalogram data to reproduce analytic pipeline assessing low theta waves to predict selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor treatment outcome in depressed patients.

There are two key analyses: first, to determine if resting state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) low theta waves within the rostral anterior cortex and frontal cortex correlate with Sertraline treatment response in the sample; secondly, to determine if rsEEG low theta waves in the right frontal and medial-frontal area predict treatment outcome with extended-release Venlafaxine.

Simply, can we predict psychiatric treatment outcome in a non-invasive method from a brain biomarker.
