## Introduction

Reproduction of Arns et al (2015)'s, "Frontal and rostral anterior cingulate (rACC) EEG in depression: Implications for treatment outcome?" My research interests consist of clinical and translational neuroscience-informed precision psychiatry research. More specifically, resting state electroencephalogram brain biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Since neuroscience is becoming more data-driven, made possible by computational advances (van Dijk et al., 2022), reproducing this paper will help me master the EEG preprocessing, python, and clinical paradigms. I chose this paper because it allows me to directly explore that field, develop my EEG data analytical skills, and I am interested in Dr. Leanne Williams's precision psychiatry research at Stanford University School of Medicine as she is one of the co-authors of this paper. There are large neuroimaging and neurophysiological databases available; therefore, focusing on learning how to analyze that mass data will be the most beneficial since I have extensive experience obtaining neuroimaging and clinical data.

The EEG data exists within the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D) database. I have obtained access to that data by reaching out to one of the data managers of that study and requesting non PHI data access to the resting state EEG data and HRSD17 scores. The stimuli in that sample were Sertaline and extended-release Venlafaxine treatments in an eight-week period with baseline resting state EEG sessions. Sertaline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Venlafaxine XR is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) 

The primary key analyses in the original paper: [1] to determine if resting state eyes closed electroencephalogram (rsEEG) low theta waves within the rostral anterior cortex and frontal cortex correlate with Sertraline and Venlafaxine XR treatment response and remission in the sample. Treatment response was determined through the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17 (HRSD17). The anticipated challenges will be correcting for multiple comparisons, preprocessing the EEG data, rACC source localization with EEG data, and replicating the data analyzing pipeline with newer versions of the eLORETA software utilized in the data analysis phase of the study.   

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

Time permitting, a secondary analysis is to determine if rsEEG low theta waves in the right frontal and medial-frontal area predict treatment outcome with extended-release Venlafaxine.

## Methods

The original paper used EEG eLORETA software for source localization and for investigating treatment prediction, a repeated measure ANOVA was conducted with within-subject factors site (Frontal and rACC). When significant interactions were found, univariate analyses were performed. .The participants conducted resting state eyes closed EEG sessions for two minutes at baseline visit and at the week-eight timepoint.The participants depression states, response to treatment, and remission state were determined from HRSD17. A score of greater than or equal to 16 meant the participants were depressed. Remission was defined as a score of less than or equal to 7 on the HRSD17 scale at the 8-week time point. Treatment response was less than 50% on the HRSD17 scale from the baseline visit. Furthermore, the original data is from iSPOT-D which a multi-center (20 sites), international, randomized, prospective practical trial. The original study had a ecological validity perspective which influenced them to not have a placebo control group to mimic real-world practice. At baseline visit the study used a mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI-Plus) to diagnose the participants with nonpsychotic MDD. After baseline visit, participants were randomized into different treatment groups. The treatment period lasted 8-weeks. Participants underwent EEG sessions at baseline and at the end of treatment. EEG data was acquired from 26 channels: Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, FC3, FCz, FC4, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4m CP3, CPz, CP4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, 01, Oz, and O2. 

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

Please describe all the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study.
(1) Obtain resting state eyes closed EEG data and HSRD17 scores.
(2) Seperate data into four groups:
  - SSRI treatment response group
  - SSRI treatment non-response group
  - SNRI treatment response group
  - SNRI treatment non-response group
(3) Create analyzing pipeline
  - quality control: remove artifacts
  - sampling rate of all channels was 500 Hz.
  - Low pass filter = 100 Hz
  - High pass filter = 0.3 Hz
  - Notch filters of 50 or 60 Hz.
  - Electrooculgram (EOG)-corrected using a regression-based technique.  
  - segment data into 4s epochs (50% overlapping).
  - artefact removal: EMG detection, pulse and baseline shift detection, crosstalk detection,     high kurtosis, extreme power level detection, residual eye blink detection, and extreme       voltage swing detection. 
  - Use a spherical spine interpolation to replace rejected channels. 
  - With eLORETA software, extract 6.5-8Hz theta waves from the rACC and frontal voxels. 
  - brain masking (making the brains the same sizes)
  - localize regions of interests in EEG data (tissue classification and segmentation)
  - Power Spectral Analysis*
  - log transform theta measures before statistical analysis. 
(4) Push data through pipeline 


### Differences from original study

Versions of software and writing the analyzing pipeline code in the same method as the original paper will be challenging. This reprodcibility study is using the following Python libraries: MNE version 1.2.1 for EEG analysis and visualization, and NumPy version 1.23.0. This replica study is using a MacBook Pro (2021) with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16 GB Memory, and with macOS Ventura 13.0 version. The macOS contains Python version 3.9.13 running on PyCharm 2022.2.2 (community Edition). VM for PyCharm is OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o. A computing environment was developed on 

Explicitly describe known differences in the analysis pipeline between the original paper and yours (e.g., computing environment). The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences may occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to influence your ability to reproduce the original results. 

### Results in original paper

The result of interest in the original paper is the phasic theta wave density relationship to treatment response. significant correlations were found between HRSD17 scores and rACC theta waves at the 8-week timepoint. P = 0.21; r = 0.093, and DF = 608.

## Discussion

First, I would like to acknowledge and thank the authors of the paper for responding rapidly and for answering all of my questions. My lack of relevant expertise in executing the EEG analytical pipeline was an obstacle, therefore the authors' assistance was crucial in reproducing this study.

while the original paper had some limitations in the EEG source localization, the algorithm was relatively new during this paper's release and more recent papers in EEG neuroimaging have improved the process by building from the mistakes in this paper. Furthermore, while I had access to this data, the data is not generally open to the research community unless licensed for a fee which may limit the possibility of others from reprodcing this study. While the paper mentioned the use of eLORETA for source localization, the paper did not mention which platform or coding libraries were used for preprocessing the data. I had to make the assumption that MNE python library was used since it is a popular library for EEG neuroimaging which may contribute as a hidden moderator. The original paper obtained structural MRI data from 10% of the participants, but it would have been very interesting to see the eLORETA algorithm implented with EEG recordings concurrelty with functional, structural, and diffusion tensor MRI data with all of the participants which would have improved the spatial and temporal resolution of the neuromiages, provided a convergence of evidence, and therefore improved source localization of the theta wave in the rACC. But, in the paper's defense this study was a good test-retest of eLORETA with flexible EEG paradigms and conducting an international multi-site clinical neuropharmaceutical study is extremly difficult to conduct and manage, and they transparently acknowledeged their limitations. This reproduction project only reproduced one analyses out of the many this study contributed to the field. The paper is also undertook a monumental task by attempting to adress the heterogenity with MDD for precisicon psychiatry. The data has also proved to be valuable for robustness checks.    

This study was a panel study with the HRSD17 since it is comparing responses of the same group of individuals at different time periods. This allows us to track individual changes over time; however, a limitation is that attrition can compromise representatives of the sample and interviewing the participants over and over may change their behavior. Additionally, due to low motivation seen in depressed populations, may cause satisficing in scale results. A meta analysis on the relaibilty of the Hamilton Rating Scale demonstrated a pooled mean for alpha coefficient in random effects model as 0.789 (Trajković et al., 2011). This suggests that HRSD provides a reliable assessment of depression. Another potential limtation with HRSD17 is the recency effect since the scale is delivered orally. 

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them).  None of these need to be long.

specific results were replicated by Ip et al recently, therefore the results should be in the right direction. All data was reanlayzed twice, with two indeoendent and different processing pipelines, and all approaches demonstrated the same direction of effects.
