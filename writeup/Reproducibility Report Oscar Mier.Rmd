## Introduction

Replication of Arns et al (2015)'s, "Frontal and rostral anterior cingulate (rACC) EEG in depression: Implications for treatment outcome?" My research interests consist of clinical and translational neuroscience-informed precision psychiatry research. More specifically, resting state electroencephalogram brain biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes in patients with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. I chose this paper because it allows me to directly explore that field, develop my EEG data analytical skills, and I am highly interested in the precision psychiatry research of Dr. Leanne Williams at Stanford University. There are large neuroimaging databases available; therefore, focusing on learning how to analyze that mass data will be the most beneficial since I have extensive experience obtaining neuroimaging and clinical data.

The EEG data exisits within the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D) database. I have obtained access to that data by reaching out to one of the data managers of that study and requesting non PHI data access. The stimuli in that sample were Sertaline and extended-release Venlafaxine treatments in an eight-week period with baseline resting state EEG sessions. There are two key analyses in the original paper: first, to determine if resting state eyes closed electroencephalogram (rsEEG) low theta waves within the rostral anterior cortex and frontal cortex correlate with Sertraline treatment response in the sample; secondly, to determine if rsEEG low theta waves in the right frontal and medial-frontal area predict treatment outcome with extended-release Venlafaxine. Treatment response was determined through the Hamilton depression scale. The anticipated challenges will be correcting for multiple comparisons, rACC source localization with EEG data, and replicating the data analyzing pipeline with newer versions of the eLORETA software utilized in the data analysis phase of the study. The link to the software is the following: http://www.uzh.ch/keyinst/loreta.htm.

## Methods

- EEG eLORETA analyses.
- resting state eyes closed EEG.
- Hamilton 17 depression rating scale. 

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

Please describe all the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study.
(1) Obtain EEG data and Hamiliton scale rating scores.
(2) Seperate data into four groups:
  - SSRI treatment response group
  - SSRI treatment non-response group
  - SNRI treatment response group
  - SNRI treatment non-response group
(3) Create analyzing pipeline
  - quality control: remove artifacts
  - brain masking (making the brains the same sizes)
  - localize regions of interests in EEG data (tissue classification and segmentation)
  - statistical analysis 
(4) Push data through pipeline 


### Differences from original study

- Versions of software
- Writing the analyzing pipeline code in the same method as the original paper

Explicitly describe known differences in the analysis pipeline between the original paper and yours (e.g., computing environment). The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences may occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to influence your ability to reproduce the original results.

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them).  None of these need to be long.
